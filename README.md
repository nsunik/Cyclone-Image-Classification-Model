# Cyclone-Image-Classification-Model
Problem Statement 

The aim of our project is to develop cyclone image classification model so the early classification and prediction will help understand  
the severity of the cyclone so that: 
- people can be warned 
- loss of lives and livelihood  would be less,
- organization can prepared well ahead to tackle the situation,
- studies and research can speed up
- new alert system can be effective



Proposed Solution

The use of advanced reading / learning (ML / DL) technology in meteorology has greatly improved in recent years.
By using CNN on satellite images of TCs and some climate data, we have tried to:
- Classify and categorize according to early images.
- Using historical data to train model.
- This in turn will help authorities be prepared beforehand
